# About Viossa

Viossa is a constructed pidgin, originally derived from a smattering of around a dozen European languages, plus Japanese, Ainu, and others. It has today come to include vocabulary and grammatical features from many more.

## How do I learn?

Viossa is taught and learned exclusively through immersion. No translation! Learning is done by having conversations with other speakers, usually on discord in text or voice calls; and using immersive resources like the Davi Hanu! podcast.

To emphasize: asking for Viossa translations to/from any language is forbidden as it breaks immersion. Exceptions to this rule are ["The Big Four" starting words](bigfour.md), and artistic projects outside of the teaching-learning cycle such as songs and poems.

## How do I contribute?

Viossa is semisolid. Most core concepts have set words and don't change, but if you want to talk deeply about a topic, you may find missing words and thus have an opportunity to coin words. However, it is also on you to ensure it can be understood by others.

## How do I teach?

When teaching using comprehensible input, it's important to immerse learners in the language through **meaningful, contextualized examples** that align with their current understanding of the world. 
- Start by using **simple** phrases and vocabulary in **visual formats**, such as pictures and emojis when teaching by text, or gestures and props when teaching by video. 
- Use **example sentences** coupled with real-life scenarios to provide context, allowing learners to infer meaning naturally.
- Use **repetition** of key structures in varied contexts to reinforce understanding and encourage active participation. 
- Additionally, tailor input to the learner's level, gradually increasing complexity as their comprehension improves. The goal is to provide input that is slightly above the learner's current level (known as "i+1") to foster learning while avoiding frustration.

## Can I speak in my native language if it isn't English? As long as it's understood, it's Viossa, right?

Speaking in another natural or constructed language is not the same as Viossa. Since Viossa is an existing semisolid language with vocabulary and structure, only Viossa is used to learn Viossa. Using a non-English language such as Spanish or Toki Pona still breaks the immersion process.

## Can I ask for translations in private messages?

As mods of the Viossa Discord Server, we can't tell people what to do outside the server, but translation in private messages is generally frowned upon in the community.

## What about etymologies?

Discussing etymologies is similar to translation, so avoid discussing the etymology of Viossa words during the learning process. Keep in mind that words often change in meaning when borrowed into another language, so the etymological meaning of a word might be different than the Viossa meaning.

## Am I allowed to keep private notes with translations?

Yes, just don't share them on the server. Many learners of Viossa choose to keep a personal dictionary, and that's fine as long as they are kept private.
