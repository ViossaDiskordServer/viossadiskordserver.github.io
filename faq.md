# About Viossa

Viossa is a constructed pidgin, originally derived from a smattering of around a dozen European languages, plus Japanese, Ainu, and others. It has today come to include vocabulary and grammatical features from many more.

## How do I learn?

Viossa is taught and learned exclusively through immersion. Most concretely, this means without translation. This also means that in general you learn by having conversations with other speakers, usually on discord, where you can learn viossa either by speaking in calls, or by typing in chats.

Usually, you won't come into Viossa knowing any words, and since you can't acquire new ones you will need to use nonverbal aids, such as images, to learn them.

## How do I contribute?

Viossa is semisolid. Starting with a few core concepts for which the words are already well-defined and seldom change, travelling outward into more narrow or specialized fields yields more mutability. The more deeply you want to talk about a topic, the more likely it is that you will find there are words missing and thus opportunities to offer new ones. 

However with this increased opportunity to create comes increased responsibility to teach: Viossa is only Viossa if other speakers can understand it. So, when you add words, you are responsible for making sure that they can be understood by others.

Discussing etymologies is close enough to translation, that usually it's best to avoid discussing the etymology of Viossa words during the learning process.
