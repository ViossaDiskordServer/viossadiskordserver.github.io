# Moderation
## Handling offenses and appeals

1. In general due to the volume of users, mods should be prepared to **shoot first and ask questions later**—of the various ways people can be harmed on the server, a hasty kick or ban is one of the more reversible.
2. If a user posts explicit sexual or gore imagery, whether directly or by linking to it, they should be banned without hesitation.
3. Slurring and verbal (especially sexual) harrassment are also cause for an immediate kick or ban at any one mod's discretion.
4. Situations which are uncertain may warrant a more charitable approach—timeout, warn, DM a user if you are uncomfortable or confused with their actions or tone, but it's not clear that a rule is being broken. Ask other mods for their opinion.
5. Users are always welcome to attempt to appeal, but generally these decisions should be made by multiple people rather than the mod receiving the request.

## Tone and representating the server

Remember that as a mod team, we represent the Viossa community.

1. Be approachable with requests from users
2. Be charitable when uncertain about someone's intent—if it's not obvious what someone means by something, ask them.
3. On server, excessive (i.e. sexually themed) flirtation or banter are not acceptable. Other mods should feel invited to ask each other to stop if this happens.
4. Off-server, please make sure to not connect the Viossa server with NSFW content e.g. by posting links on an NSFW twitter or by being inappropriately vulgar in other conlanging spaces.

#Administration

1. Prioritize making informed changes to the server, e.g. with the input and consent of the most active and involved user—polling @Viossadjin is one good way to collect data before making changes.
2. Please consider the ergonomics of various changes; are they substantially disruptive or confusing? Have we considered accessibility?
3. Be receptive and respectful towards feedback about changes to the server, and communicate openly with other administrators if there is an issue that needs to be fixed.
4. Yewald and Yewaldnen are encouraged to use [the Jewald trello board](https://trello.com/b/zePpUyYJ/jewald) to stay organized if there are a large number of tasks that cannot be addressed at once.
