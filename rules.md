# Rules
**Summary:**
1. No translation (except [the four translatables](https://viossadiskordserver.github.io/bigfour))
2. If it's understood, it's Viossa.
3. The chats in the Viossa Only category are Viossa only.
4. This server is SFW. No sexually explicit, gory, or violent content.
5. Respect one another and don't use hate speech.
6. Respect the rulings of the staff (@Yewald)
7. Discussion of controversial topics (politics, war, etc.) should be directed to #polite, which requires the @ike role. @ike comes with guidelines.

## 1: No translation
Translation is not how we learn and teach Viossa. Instead, we teach using pictures, diagrams, video calls, and other aids to couple words to meaning.

On the Viossa Diskordserver, you are allowed to translate the following four words. If you want an extra challenge, don't click the link! [The big four.](https://viossadiskordserver.github.io/bigfour)

Outside of the teaching-learning cycle, we also make an exception for artistic translations (such as those of songs, books, or poems), as well as for academic translations (such as for a formal research paper). In both cases, this exception is dependent on translations of either class appearing in the appropriate place. If you're not sure where that is, please ask.

Additionally, please don't attempt to derive or share translation-based learning materials on-server, or poach members for such a purpose.

## 2: If it's understood, it's Viossa
All that is required to speak Viossa is that other speakers be able to understand you. There is no right or wrong way to speak or write, and no global standard.

However, Viossa is a collaborative group project: members should strive to make others understand them, and in return make an effort to understand others.

## 3: Viossa-only chats
Chats in the **Viossa Only** section do not permit English. If you must use English to coach learners on the learning process, go to #meta instead.

This doesn't mean that other channels are English-only, though! Viossa is allowed everywhere.

## 4: SFW
If a mod does not like what you have posted, they will inform you; see rule 6. This is a public Discord server, think before you post.

## 5: Respect one another
Respect one another. Using slurs or hate speech against others, whether on- or off-server, or advocating for violence are not welcome. This is an LGBTQ+ friendly international community.

## 6: Respect the staff's rulings
The word of staff (the Yewald as well as the Yewaldnen) is final, and they may kick, ban, or mute members or change members' access permissions to make sure this environment stays respectful and puts the Viossa community first.

Appeals will always be considered, and if you feel that a mod action was inappropriate, you can DM any Yewald or open a ticket with YAGPDB's `/ticket open` command.

## 7: #polite and ike
Many are life's troubling realities, and vast is our need to discuss them. The **ike** category is an opt-in set of chats where discussion of heavy, sensitive, or potentially contentious topics is allowed, provided that users are especially respectful of each other during such discussions. By accepting the ike role, you agree to adhere to this rule and encourage others to do the same.

### Venting vs seeking advice
Sometimes you want to let people know that you're dealing with an issue and just be acknowledged, other times you want help in solving a problem. If you are open to one but not the other, it's often a good idea to let people know as part of the discussion so that you can receive the kind of responses you are looking for.

### Self-harm and Violence
While discussing self-harm in general is allowed (with appropriate and clear use of content warnings), this server in itself is not an emergency mental health resource, and is not a substitute for professional help. Asking others for advice in finding support or resources off-server is fine, but asking others to participate in talking you down is inappropriate. 

You should not use this space to:
- express intent or desire to harm yourself or others
- solicit help in stopping yourself from harming yourself or someone else

By crossing these boundaries, please be aware that you are asking members of the server (including moderators and the owner) to perform a role for which they are not trained or equipped. At the moderators' sole discretion, this may not be tolerated and may result in a warning, timeout, removal of the @ike role, or removal from the server.

If you are struggling with thoughts of this nature, but are not immediately in danger, please consider seeking counseling. If you are experiencing an immediate crisis, please call 988 (in the United States), 999 (in the UK), or locate an emergency hotline appropriate for you.
