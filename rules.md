# Rules
**Summary:**
1. No translation (except [the four translatables](https://viossadiskordserver.github.io/bigfour))
2. If it's understood, it's Viossa.
3. The chats in the Viossa Only category are Viossa only.
4. This server is SFW. No sexually explicit, gory, or violent content.
5. Don't use hate speech.
6. Respect each other
7. Respect the rulings of the staff (@Yewald)
8. Discussion of controversial topics (politics, war, etc.) should be directed to #polite, which requires the \@ike role.

## 1: No translation
Translation is not how we learn and teach Viossa. Instead, we teach using pictures, diagrams, video calls, and other aids to couple words to meaning.

On the Viossa Diskordserver, you are allowed to translate the following four words. If you want an extra challenge, don't click the link! [The big four.](https://viossadiskordserver.github.io/bigfour)

Outside of the teaching-learning cycle, we also make an exception for artistic translations (such as those of songs, books, or poems), as well as for academic translations (such as for a formal research paper). In both cases, this exception is dependent on translations of either class appearing in the appropriate place. If you're not sure where that is, please ask.

Additionally, please don't attempt to derive or share translation-based learning materials on-server, or poach members for such a purpose.

## 2: If it's understood, it's Viossa
All that is required to speak Viossa is that other speakers be able to understand you. There is no right or wrong way to speak or write, and no global standard. However, Viossa is collaborative: members should attempt to make others understand them, and members should attempt to understand.

## 3: Viossa-only chats
This is self-explanatory—some chats do not permit English. If you must use English to coach learners on the learning process, go to #meta instead.

## 4: SFW
Self-explanatory. If a mod does not like what you have posted, they will inform you; see rule 7.

## 5: No hate speech
Slurring others—whether others on the server or off it—or advocating for violence is not welcome. This is an LGBTQ+ friendly international community.

## 6: Respect each other
Self-explanatory. If a mod does not like what you have posted, they will inform you; see rule 7.

## 7: Respect the staff's rulings
While appeals will always be considered, the staff (the Yewald as well as the Yewaldnen) reserve the right to kick, ban, mute, or alter the permissions of members to preserve a respectful environment.

If you believe a mod has abused their powers, you may appeal via DM or create a ticket through YAGPDB using the `/ticket open` command.

## 8: #polite and ike
Many are life's troubling realities, and vast is our need to discuss them. The **ike** category is an opt-in set of chats where discussion of heavy, sensitive, or potentially contentious topics is allowed, provided that users are especially respectful of each other's views during such discussions. By accepting the ike role, you agree to adhere to this guideline and encourage others to do the same.
