## No Translation
Translation kills the magic of immersion and is not how we learn and teach Viossa. Don't use the language of origin to teach a word -- it's not as bad as translation, but it can be a cheat/hint if someone knows the language in question. The "Viossakaban" channel is for viossa only!
### The Big Four
You are allowed to translate the following four words and no others. Don't unspoiler if you want to try to learn in hard-mode!!! 
fshto = understand
ka = what
ak(ku(rat)) = yes
nai = no

## If it's understood, it's Viossa
Try to be creative while letting others be creative too, even if what they do seems strange at first. Mutual understanding is key.

## Contributing
Viossa is already developed at its core, so while things change all the time, you will find most basic concepts already have basic words. You may be met with skepticism if you try to re-coin one. However, areas like science and games still have semantic gaps because they are less commonly-discussed. You're encouraged to fill in those gaps through conversing in Viossa, letting others participate in the process in every way possible. Here are some tips that will help avoid stepping on others' toes:
- ask if a word already exists for a meaning
- invite them to coin related terms, such as a word with the opposite meaning
- welcome other people to ask clarifying questions
- ask more people over time if they've understood the new vocabulary
