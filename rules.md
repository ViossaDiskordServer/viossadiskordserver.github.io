## If it's understood, it's Viossa
If others can understand you, then it's probably viossa. 
If nobody can understand you, try to make yourself understood. 
If you can understand someone else, then it's probably viossa. 
If you can't, try to learn how.

## Contributing
Viossa is already developed at its core, so while things change all the time, you will find most basic concepts already have basic words. You may be met with skepticism if you try to re-coin one. However, areas like science and games still have semantic gaps because they are less commonly-discussed. You're encouraged to fill in those gaps through conversing in Viossa, letting others participate in the process in every way possible. Here are some tips that will help avoid stepping on others' toes:
- ask if a word already exists for a meaning
- invite them to coin related terms, such as a word with the opposite meaning
- welcome other people to ask clarifying questions
- ask more people over time if they've understood the new vocabulary
