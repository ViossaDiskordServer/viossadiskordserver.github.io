1. Ask for it
2. Are given majority approval by current Viossadjin

There are no specific acceptance criteria, that is there are no rules that should be followed when voting, but a few examples of things that earn the role are:
- Simply talking often and comfortably with others in Viossa
- Showing confidence in teaching the language
- Showing thoughtful consideration about the future of the language and what is good for its community

- Creation of rich or useful texts in Viossa, such as news articles or encyclopedia pages on [vikoli.org](https://vikoli.org)
- Collaboration with other members of the community on projects like the above

There is also a **@mellandjin** role which serves as an intermediary step on the way to being a Viossadjin. This role is granted to users who:
1. Are nominated by a Viossadjin
2. Are given majority approval by current Viossadjin
3. Are not veto'd by a Moderator (Yewaldnen or Yewald)

Similar to the above, there are no specific criteria, but someone usually qualifies for @Mellandjin if they are recognizable participants in the community, even if their skills in Viossa are not quite to the level of Viossadjin.
