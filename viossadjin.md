# About the Viossadjin role
The Viossa Diskordserver has a role called **@Viossadjin**, which is granted to users who:
1. Demonstrate a level of involvement in Viossa the language and Viossa the culture
2. Follow the spirit of Viossa in that involvement
3. Ask for it

There are no specific acceptance criteria, but a few examples of things that earn the role are:
- Simply talking often and comfortably with others in Viossa
- Showing confidence in teaching the language
- Creation of artistic material in Viossa
- Creation of rich or useful texts in Viossa, such as news articles or encyclopedia pages on [vikoli.org](https://vikoli.org)
- Collaboration with other members of the community on projects like the above

There is also a newer **@mellandjin** role which serves as an intermediary step on the way to being a Viossadjin.
